                    <h1>Meet Jonathan Sandler</h1>
                    <h3>Frontend Web developer</h3>
                    <p>I have been an entrepreneur for over 9 years in the Natural Medicine field, and since 2019 I have incursion myself into Software Development. I have worked for different clients and companies for over a year now.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        I am currently the Team Leader of Front-end at Armada Aeronautics, an automotive company that is disrupting the car industry with its innovative flying vehicle. I am in charge of designing, building, and maintaining the five most critical systems of the vehicle, and doing research to improve the UI over time. I supervise the work of my teammates and we work together to improve features while implementing cutting-edge technologies. I have also done several projects for independent clients; you can check them out at jsdesigns.us.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        I entered Armada Aeronautics at a very critical time. My first assignment was to deliver the two core systems of the flying vehicle in 10 weeks. I had no previous experience in the industry, I was allowed to use only HTML, CSS, minimum JQuery, and all functionalities had to fully work offline. I designed, built, tested, and supervised every step; I had both systems done in 5 weeks. My area of expertise: Restful APIs, JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        At Armada, time was limited so I focused on building simple and functional components to reuse them across the platform. This way I was able to code faster and avoid new bugs. The UI was rather simple but I had the core functionalities working. Once the biggest issues were addressed, I was able to prioritize and improved the rest of the features based on the remaining time I had.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        Competent work is at your disposal, take it.
                        <br></br>
                        I look forward to hearing from you.Â </p>
